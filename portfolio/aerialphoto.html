                <p>While at university I was heavily involved in the organization of the engineering orientation week. I ran the Aerial Photo event for the last three years of my undergrad. This event involved creating a design, placement planning, and communicating for a successful event. </p>

            <p>The design of the photo is based off the year, and the theme of that week. The photo is taken off a building which means it was taken at an angle, as such clean straight lines are what makes a clear design. After the design is finalized we moved to an 'old school' method of transfer it to grid paper and scaling it.</p>

            <p> The scaling on grid paper is to fit all the people in the photo with four people per metre squared. The final step is to divide the design by team, indicated by colour. Unfortunately that year it rained on the day of the event, which meant we moved to the rain plan. This involved completely redoing the layout to match the small number of people. The video below shows a timelapse of the rain date event. </p>

                <h2>Always starts with a crazy idea</h2>
                <p>At the end of our engineering degrees we all have a 'Capstone Project' that is an 8 month project to apply everything you have learned in your degree. When my group came together to try to decide what to do the main requirement from my teammates was, <strong>not software</strong>. Which led us to think that perhaps we could design and build a desk.</p>
                <p>We set off to apply our product design knowledge and build a desk optimized for moving. Starting with a brainstorming process to building low, medium, and high fidelity prototypes to finally building the design with ideal materials. At our final symposium we won "Best Entrepreneurial Team" with a cash reward. </p>

            <h2>Finding my role</h2>
            <p>From the outset of the project, I had very little interest in the physically building of the desk. Instead I took the lead on other key aspect of the project including: the project management with weekly meeting and deliverable coordination, leading the marketing collatoral for our presentations, and developing our symposium poster.</p>
            <p>The approach to the marketing was an infused a sense of playfulness but respecting the academic nature of the project. With the title of the project being a play on 'no assembly required', adding an asterisk to reflect the fun nature. Balancing the font with colour ascents and dark grey.</p>

            <h2>Apply user research methodology</h2>
            <p>One aspect I was especially proud of was the product testing we completed. We wanted to determine if the assembly and disassembly of the desk was truly intuitive. Two rounds of testing were complete. The first round was completed with the high-fidelity prototype made out of cardboard after which we adjusted the design based on the findings, the second round on the completed desk confirmed the success of our design.</p>
            <p>To complete this product testing on top of a testing methodology we also needed instructions. I completed some research on how to create good instructions and also referenced some of the techniques that IKEA uses. My approach was to couple visual cues along with textual instructions to clarify any unclear aspects.</p>

                <h2>So Many options, so little time</h2>
                <p>Since graduating and starting my first fulltime position I knew that I wanted to try to apply my development skills to building this personal webpage. The real question was where to start from? I knew that I wanted to have a parralax feel but not based directly off a template. If I were to do it again I would've choose a more mobile friendly CSS framework</p> <img src="assets/img/portfolio/intro.png" class="oneImg" />
                <p>I wanted a large feature right from the start of the page followed by brief, focused content. The colour scheme was inspired by the initial background I made using an online geometric tool. The coordination of the burgundy, orange, deep grey, and white was very intentional compared to the more traditional colours of blue or green. </p> <a href="https://github.com/mjmcneil/mjmcneil.github.io" class="externalLink">Github repo</a>

            <h2>Making a Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Recently added a portfolio section for website. Went with a simpler theme overall, sticking to black and white for stark contrast and emphasis on the photo cotent. For the font, I chose two Google fonts: bold uppercase heading with Oswald and body text in Muli.</p>

                <h2>What is a Hackathon?</h2>
                <p>This is a question a colleague asked me when I suggested we organize one for our greater team. He had just told me about a script he was writing in Python that he was developing on his own time in order to speed up his work. This got me thinking of how we could not only get him the time to develop such a productivity enhancement project but encourage such thinking within other teams. Together we prepared a pitch for our upper management, once we got the green light, we started developing what would be a 2 day hackathon with 20 participants.</p>

            <h2>What's next?</h2>
            <p>Over the next month and a half we prepared and organized the Hackathon independently with almost no input or influence from management. Balancing this planning with our day-to-day workload required quick, informed decision making and a solid direction. Overall the event was extremely successful with many of the projects moving forward to real solutions.</p> <img src="assets/img/portfolio/dino.png" width="100%" style="margin:20px 0;" />
            <p>The one aspects the other credited beyond the organization of the event was the presentation of the collateral surrounding the event. Specifically for the event, I created an HTML email template to be used for all of the recruiting, built a fun informative video explaining what a Hackathon is, and powerpoint template with suggested layouts. One of the creatives that I added was to provide an outline of cute dinosaurs to show that anyone could participate, independent of age or experience level. This concept was further embraced in that we used toy dinosaurs as prizes and all of the winning designers display them on their desks.</p>
